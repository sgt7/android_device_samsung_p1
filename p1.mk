# This file is the device-specific product definition file for P1000 devices. 
# It lists all the overlays, files, modules and properties that are specific 
# to this hardware: i.e. those are device-specific drivers, configuration 
# files, settings, etc...
#
# Note that P1000 is not a fully open device. Some of the drivers aren't publicly
# available, which means that some of the hardware capabilities aren't present 
# in builds where those drivers aren't available. Such cases are handled by having
# the configuration separated into two halves: this half here contains the parts
# that are available to everyone, while another half in the vendor/ hierarchy 
# augments that set with the parts that are only relevant when all the associated
# drivers are available. Aspects that are irrelevant but harmless in no-driver
# builds should be kept here for simplicity and transparency.

# This is the hardware-specific overlay, which points to the location
# of hardware-specific resource overrides, typically the frameworks and
# application settings that are stored in resourced.

# There are two variants of the half that deals with the unavailable drivers: one
# is directly checked into the unreleased vendor tree and is used by engineers who
# have access to it. The other is generated by setup-makefile.sh in the same
# directory as this files, and is used by people who have access to binary versions 
# of the drivers but not to the original vendor tree. Be sure to update both.
